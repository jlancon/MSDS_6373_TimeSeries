Required Texts:
Applied Time Series Analysis with R; 2nd Edition (Woodward, Gray, Elliott) Chapman and Hall/CRC, 2011.

Prerequisites:
N/A

Learning Objectives: The student will;
• Learn why it is necessary to treat time series data differently and to provide them with the theory 
and methods to appropriately model such data. 
• Learn to apply these methods through lectures, lightboard sessions, coding in R, real-life data sets,
and interviews with currently practicing industry professionals. 

Course Overview
• Many problems in industry and scientific research involve observations recorded over time.
Traditional modeling methods are not appropriate for this type of data as the observations are not 
independent but rather serially correlated. This course provides the student with a working knowledge of
several parametric and non-parametric models to both estimate population parameters and forecast future
values. In addition, the course provides extensive practice in working with the statistical package R in
estimating and visualizing these models and does so through the use of numerous real-world data sets.
